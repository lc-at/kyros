# How to contribute
First of all, we would like to thank you for reading this. Kyros needs volunteer developers to strive and grow.
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Kyros.
Those are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Testing
Since Kyros is a wrapper to WhatsApp Web API, it is quite hard to automate tests. This far, we haven't made any automated tests (if you have an idea, feel free to propose it).
Before you submit your changes, please make sure that they work properly and don't break other things.

## Submitting changes
Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done. A brief summary will also be helpful.
Before submitting, try reading your pull request. If you find it easy to understand, it should be good to go.

## Coding conventions
Kyros is a Python project and therefore should comply to the [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding style standard.
> "Beautiful is better than ugly." 
â€” one of the lines in the Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

The use of linters like `flake8` will be very helpful. Sometimes, there are some times where you really have to break the rules.
Just make sure that you write a consistent (with the whole project), efficient, and readable enough code.
