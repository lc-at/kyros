Kyros is a python wrapper or an API for WhatsApp Web.
It is based on the reverse engineered version of WhatsApp Web (https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng).
Some references are also coming from one of the reimplementation of whatsapp-web-reveng, https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp.

The work is still on progress. But somehow, it is just currently halted for me (I will continue doing it in the future).
Any form of contribution are welcomed. I will happily review your pull requests. There are lots of things to be done.

Already done:
- Websocket communication (basic things like connecting, handling json messages and their respective tags)
- Doing QR login
- Key generation
- Logging out
- Session management (basic things like import and export from a file)

Currently doing:
- Session restoration
- Read from existing session

To-do:
- Decrypting messages
- Encrypting messages
- Reading messages
- Sending messages
- Handling messages
- ...
- A good exception/error handling in Kyros
